Firefox 31 is the first browser to support CSS3 Variables,
so here are my first CSS hacks using them.

Just make sure that you use a different variable in each definition.
They really are variables, not constants, so they can override each other.

/* Firefox 31+ (CSS3 Variable Method) */

_:-moz-tree-row(hover), .selector 
{
    --this-variable:value; property:var(--this-variable);
}

And using a supports method…

/* Firefox 31+ (CSS3 Variable Method) */

@supports (-moz-appearance:meterbar) 
{
    .selector 
    {
       --this-variable:value; property:var(--this-variable);
    }
}

Other browsers are supposed to follow suit, but for now just Firefox 31 and newer.

Example Usage:

/* Firefox 31+  */

_:-moz-tree-row(hover), .ff31up 
{
   --myvar1: navy; background-color: var(--myvar1);
   --myvar2: white; color: var(--myvar2); 
}

This will show up in white on dark blue in Firefox >= 31

<div class='ff31up'>
   Firefox 31 and Newer (Using CSS3 Variables)
</div>

I just submitted this to the browserhacks.com forum
