I have been working on finding a way to target Androids or iPads/iPhones (separately) and this one I have worked out appears to do the job nicely.

This one is one I just made this weekend. It targets webkit (chrome/safari/android browser) but this one segregates itself from iOS devices. In other words, this one works on Android and Desktop/Laptop devices but not on iPad/iPhone.

/* Safari 5.1+, Chrome 15+, Android Browser (Android 4+, not iOS) */
/* Desktops, Laptops, Mobiles */

_:-webkit-full-screen, :root .selector { property:value; }
If you wish to target hi-def mobiles, but not desktops/laptops:

/* Chrome 15+, Android Browser (Android 4+, not iOS) */
/* Mobiles (High-Definition) */

@media screen and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio:1.1) {
    _:-webkit-full-screen, .selector { property:value; } 
}
Or conversely, if you wish to avoid hi-def mobiles but target desktops (and old non-hi-definition mobiles) this should do the trick:

/* Safari 5.1+, Chrome 15+, Android Browser (Android 4+, not iOS) */
/* Desktops, Laptops, Old Mobiles (Not High-Definition) */

@media screen and (-webkit-max-device-pixel-ratio:1) {
    _:-webkit-full-screen, .selector { property:value; } 
}
