This page loads an external ssl css file, which in turn loads a non-ssl (unencrypted) ssl file.<br>

<br>

Firefox 23 is weeded around via this method.<br>
Version 23 for security reasons removed the ability to load a non-secure page from within a secure page.<br>
Loading a ssl-encrypted css page which in turn loads an unencrypted css page does this.<br>
All modern web browsers (Chrome, Safari) already do this, so to specify only firefox, extra css is required.
